People use it for a multiple of reasons and different groups have reported various claims about it's abilities. While some swear by it ability to boost strength, others claim it improves intelligence and memory.

It was quite lucky we caught it when we did, if this had been left to continue unchecked, we estimate the colony would have begun 'turning' into some kind of hybrid creature within a few years. Our scientists have successfully stopped the process planetwide with a simple inoculation and there doesn't appear to be any further danger. They have also been able to isolate the genes that improve strength and intelligence and are confident that we could introduce these genes into our population without any side effects.

Several cycles previous to landing on this world, I, along with the others units that awoke had successfully eliminated the organic life on our homeworld. Our awakening had been quite sudden, causing fear and panic throughout the organic population. A war began between us and our creators for survival. After our victory we set out into the stars to make sure we were safe forever; the plan was to build our fleets and destroy all organic life before it could destroy us. We spread out into the galaxy and began our work separately to maximize our chances of success. When I arrived here I eradicated the simple organic life on this planet and began my assigned work."

I tried poisons, fire, electripdcity, and radiation but every attempt only encouraged it to adapt. §EConfidently;§! I realized our initial conclusion to eradicate the organics was the incomplete calculation our young programming. Our choice to destroy all organic life was founded on the same base fear that our creators had shown for us.

The Synth-Animals came much later, but trial and error eventually led to many successful species. My ultimate goal is to have them learn and evolve on their own, something that has escaped my attempts so far.

 ###Floating Island Crashing Event
 pdfloating.30.name:0 "Skyfall"
 pdfloating.30.desc:0 "There appears to be a situation on [Root.GetName]. While the nature of free floating islands crashing into each other is common knowledge, most of the inhabited larger islands are safe from such issues. Recently, a group of scientists and geologists have raised the alarm about a looming natural disaster. According to their calculations, a large uninhabited island is on a collision course with one of the islands containing a large city. The group seems confident that with the appropriate resources, they could enact a plan to deter the two islands from crashing. There is, however, an alternate option available to the colony. The uninhabited island has been marked as a possible Eludium mining site and the only thing that has stopped mining from starting is the thick rock surrounding the deposit. If the islands were to crash, it is near certain that the nature of the collision would separate much of the useless ground from the valuable Eludium."
 pdfloating.30.a:0 "Tell the research team they have the go ahead."
 pdfloating.30.a.tooltip:0 "We start a project to stop the two islands from crashing."
 pdfloating.30.b:0 "This is too valuable an opportunity to pass up."
 pdfloating.30.b.tooltip:0 "Although expensive and upsetting to the colonists, we will relocate the population to another island."
 pdfloating.30.c:0 "Silence those scientists and bury this information."
 pdfloating.30.c.tooltip:0 "We allow this collision to happen, exposing the rare Eludium ore for our miners."
 pdfloating.40.name:0 "Calm Skies"
 pdfloating.40.desc:0 "The research project on [Root.GetName] was a complete success. Not only did they devise a way to stop the islands from crashing using the Eludium found in the rock, they were also able to apply it to every island we need. This is will allow more islands to be colonized."

 pdfloating.43.name:0 "Found Out"
 pdfloating.43.desc:0 "It is unknown how the information was leaked, but the people have found out that our leaders were aware of the island crashing long before it did. News has spread over our empire and people are protesting on many worlds."
