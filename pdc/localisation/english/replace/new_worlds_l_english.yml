 ###New Worlds Localisations

 #planet classes
 pc_large_asteroid_moon:0 "大型环绕小行星"
 pc_large_asteroid_moon_desc:0 "可能是一颗被这颗行星的重力所俘获的小行星。\n\n"
 pc_small_asteroid_moon:0 "小型环绕小行星"
 pc_small_asteroid_moon_desc:0 "可能是一颗被这颗行星的重力所俘获的小行星。\n\n"
 pc_greenhouse_hot:0 "热还原性星球"
 pc_greenhouse_hot_desc:0 "一个有浓厚的高压大气的岩石行星。大气中的气体造成温室效应失控，造成非常高的表面温度。" 
 pc_greenhouse_cold:0 "冷还原性星球"
 pc_greenhouse_cold_desc:0 "一个有浓厚的高压大气的岩石行星。尽管远离母星，大气中的气体却引起温室效应，使表面上存在甲烷和乙烷等特殊液体。" 
 pc_gas_giant_hot:0 "超巨行星"
 pc_gas_giant_hot_desc:0 "A large gaseous planet with an atmosphere primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. The planet is in close proximity to the parent star and so has a very high surface temperature and a short orbital period. The atmosphere is extreme and exotic due to the short period and long days, with intense winds and super-rotating equatorial jet streams."
 pc_ice_giant:0 "冰巨行星"
 pc_ice_giant_desc:0 "These frozen giants are vastly different in composition from their gaseous brethren. The core is mostly rock and ice, surrounded by tenuous layers of water, methane, and ammonia. Additionally, the magnetic field is sharply inclined to the axis of rotation. Class I planets form on the fringe of a star system."
 pc_dwarf_planet_asteroid:0 "矮行星"
 pc_dwarf_planet_asteroid_desc:0 "A Class D planetoid is a tiny world that generally does not meet the criteria for a planet, this includes moons, asteroids, and small planet-like objects. Dwarf planetoids can be composed of rock or ice, many are not even spherical, and have eccentric orbits cluttered with various even smaller objects."
 pc_marginal:0 "温暖边缘型行星"
 pc_marginal_desc:0 "These marginal worlds, also known as "Super-Earths", are generally similar to Class M planets, but on a larger scale and with smaller water coverege. The Warm sub-class tends to be rocky and forested, and while they are suitable for life, the scarce water supply makes natural evolution more difficult."
 pc_irradiated_marginal:0 "辐射边缘型行星"
 pc_irradiated_marginal_desc:0 "These marginal worlds, also known as "Super-Earths", have barren and irradiated surfaces, lacking a strong magnetosphere to protect it from its star's radiation. Despite harsh surface conditions, liquid bodies of water can be found that offer enough protection from radiation allowing some vegetation and life to exist."
 pc_marginal_cold:0 "寒冷超级类地行星"
 pc_marginal_cold_desc:0 "These marginal worlds, also known as "Super-Earths", are generally similar to Class M planets, but on a larger scale and with smaller water coverege. The Cold sub-class tends to be frigid and rocky, with large bodies of frozen water, except in lower latitudes where liquid water and vegetation can be found."
 pc_geometallic:0 "金属地质行星"
 pc_geometallic_desc:0 "As a Class E world cools, the crust and core solidify and the planet becomes Class F. These barren worlds are witness to much geologic activity, steam expelled from volcanic eruptions condenses into water and forms the first shallow seas, in which bacteria may develop and ultimately thrive. As the core of a Class F planet cools, the volcanic activity lessens and the planet eventually transitions to Class G."
 pc_geocrystalline:0 "寒武纪行星"
 pc_geocrystalline_desc:0 "在F级行星的核心充分冷却之后，火山活动减弱并且行星变为G级。在大气中存在一些丰度的氧和氮，从而引发日益复杂的生物体，如藻类等原始植物和类似海绵和海蜇的动物。 随着G级星球的不断冷却，它可以最终转变为其演化的最后阶段。" 
 pc_geomorteus:0 "濒日岩石行星"
 pc_geomorteus_desc:0 "Class B planets are small, rocky worlds located within a star system's hot zone. Unsuitable for humanoid life, Class B planets have highly unstable molten surfaces. The thin atmospheres are composed primarily of helium and sodium. In the harsh daylight, temperatures can approach 450º Celsius, because there is little atmosphere to retain that heat, it can get as cold as -200º Celsius at night. No life forms have even been observed on Class B worlds."
 pc_geoplastic:0 "塑性地质行星"
 pc_geoplastic_desc:0 "Class E worlds represent the earliest stage in the formation of a habitable planet. The core and crust are completely molten, making the planet susceptible to solar winds and radiation, and subject to extremely high surface temperatures. The atmosphere is very thin and composed of hydrogen and helium. As the planet cools, the core and crust begin to harden and the planet becomes Class F."
 pc_lush:0 "青葱行星"
 pc_lush_desc:0 "Lush worlds have a temperate climate with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and a resilient ecosystem. Climate variation is very low, resulting in lush terrain dominating its land masses which are separated by mostly shallow seas. Cold and dry climates are only found near the poles and mountain tops, while deserts are usually non-existent as precepitation levels are similar in every latitude and seasonal variation is minimal. This planet type can be considered perfect for any species that evolved in temperate worlds." 
 pc_retinal:0 "视黄醛行星"
 pc_retinal_desc:0 "视黄醛星球通常具有温带和潮湿的气候，显示密集的植被，其使用视黄醛而不是叶绿素，可能是从低光度的恒星或气体巨型卫星发展而来。 绝大多数视黄醛世界被潮汐锁定，但由于温室效应，火山活动增加有助于保持条件稳定。" 
 pc_irradiated_terrestrial:0 "辐射类地行星"
 pc_irradiated_terrestrial_desc:0 "These terrestrial worlds have barren and irradiated surfaces, lacking a strong magnetosphere to protect it from its star's radiation. Despite harsh surface conditions, liquid oceans of water can be found that offer enough protection from radiation allowing some vegetation and life to exist. If not for the irradiated surface, this world would very likely be re-classified as Class M."
